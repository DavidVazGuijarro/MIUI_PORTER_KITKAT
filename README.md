This is my collection of automated porting scripts.

## Requirements
- Java
- 7za (7 zip)
- AAPT
- Android SDK
- Ubuntu 12.04+

If you don't have Ubuntu, don't try and run my scripts. These are public just because I lost them in a HDD Crash, not because I am here to help everyone port using my script, but feel free to learn off of it and develop your own. Or use mine as a base. I do not mind.

Put credit where credit is due.
